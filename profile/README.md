**Welcome to the NoFrixion Github!**

**We provide an API service that allows you to programtically move money (pay and get paid).**

**Our service = Card Gateway + Open Banking + Bank Account****

We are based in Ireland and support the following payment networks:

- Cards (Visa, MasterCard, ApplePay, GooglePay etc)
- SEPA (European Union Euro zone bank network)
- Faster Payments (UK GBP bank network)
- Open Banking (while not a payment network this is an API specification for access to the EU and UK bank networks)
- Bitcoin
- Bitcoin Lightning


** We are not a Bank but our current accounts are equivalent to a Bank account for payments.
